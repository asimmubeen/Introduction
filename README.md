# Me My Miny Mo

I am a physicist with experience and interest in data science, machine learning, signal processing and intelligent machines. I have experience in machine learning, Bayesian data analysis, signal processing, and image analysis especially neuroimage analysis. My research includes algorithm development, signal detection and source separation. I also like data analysis, pattern recognition, big data exploration, and application of machine learning. I worked with various types of neuroimage modalities like structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion weighted MR-images (DWI), PET images, EEG, and cognitive measures. 

I am also Oracle certified professional and working in various database management systems like MySQL and MariaDB for my needs to store and manage big data. I also work in PHP for front-end design for web-base applications. For recent futute, I am exploring the data science via Python, R and SQL.

Cricket and squash used to be my "goto sane" strategies. Now I found peace in light gardening, walking around and watching some tv. I like to fix things: computers? yes, appliances? yes, hardware? yes, toys? yes, cars? Hmmm ...
