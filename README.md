# About Me

I am a physicist with a strong background in data science, machine learning, and signal processing. My experience includes developing algorithms for signal detection and source separation, conducting Bayesian data analysis, and working with neuroimage modalities such as structural MRI, functional MRI, DWI, PET images, EEG, and cognitive measures. Additionally, I have expertise in database management systems like MySQL and MariaDB for handling big data, as well as experience with front-end design using PHP. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by exploring data science with Python, R, and SQL.

When I need to unwind, I enjoy light gardening, walking, and watching TV. I also have a handyman side and love to fix things around the house, including computers, appliances, hardware, and toys. While I used to play cricket and squash, I have found new ways to find peace and balance in my life.
