# About Me

I am a physicist with a strong background in data science, machine learning, and signal processing. My experience includes developing algorithms for signal detection, source separation, Bayesian-based solutions, and image analysis. I also have experience in neuroimage analysis. The modalities I worked with include structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, PET images, and EEG. Additionally, I have expertise in database management systems like MySQL and MariaDB for handling big data, as well as experience with front-end design using PHP. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by exploring data science with Python, R, and SQL.

When I need to unwind, I enjoy light gardening, walking, and watching TV. I also have a handyman side and love to fix things around my house, including computers, appliances, hardware, toys and cellphones too. While I used to play cricket and squash in the past, I have found new ways to find peace and balance in my life.
